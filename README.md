# Obsidian AsciiDoc Blocks Plugin

This is a plugin to render AsciiDoc blocks in Obsidian, initially **focused on tables**. 'Cause markdown tables are so limited!

## Examples

See examples in [README.adoc](README.adoc). There are some examples unsupported in basic markdown markup.

For more information about [AsciiDoc Tables](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/build-a-basic-table/).

## IMPORTANT

At the moment any AsciiDoc feature might work, but there isn't any warranty and support! I hope in the future I could support other features officially!

Maybe I'll restrain `asciidoc-table` for only support tables and create another unsupported block: `asciidoc-raw`.

## Thanks

-   The first inspiration (and some code) came from [Obsidian Admonition](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition), thanks @valentine195;
-   So many thanks, @francbreno for introducing me to Obsidian and spending some time discussing the idea of this plugin.
